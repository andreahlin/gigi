                <p>I am a maker! Depending on the day, that could look like building well-designed software,
                    creating artwork, or experimenting with different mediums, both digital and analog. I
                    bring an attitude of curiosity, empathy, and excellence to each challenge I encounter. </p>

                <p> I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a BSE in computer graphics.
                    I am currently a software engineer at Elsevier. </p>
